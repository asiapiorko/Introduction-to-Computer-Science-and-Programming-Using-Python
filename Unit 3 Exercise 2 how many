Consider the following sequence of expressions:

animals = { 'a': ['aardvark'], 'b': ['baboon'], 'c': ['coati']}

animals['d'] = ['donkey']
animals['d'].append('dog')
animals['d'].append('dingo')
We want to write some simple procedures that work on dictionaries to return information.

First, write a procedure, called how_many, which returns the sum of the number of values associated with a dictionary. For example:

>>> print(how_many(animals))
6
